# PythonPSO
My first try on an serious Python project, and it's about PSO Algorithm integrated for Matching Network

To understand the work, I suggest you read either *MN_handle.ipynp* or *PSOsinc.ipynp* first:

- *MN_handle.ipynp* is about general input/output Matching Network calculations

- *PSOsinc.ipynp* is to go through every step of Particle Swam Optimization. This step is important for later development, it simplifies a lot if you want later use PSO for other calculations

After that, you can jump into *PSOMatchingNetwork.ipynp* file to see how I merged these files above.

The *PSOMatchingNetwork_wideband.ipynp* is to calculate for wider band matching. Its input is from .s1p file.

One more update with *PSO_switchingMN_wideband.ipynp*, with this one, the topology and components' types is switched to look for more than one fixed option. But it takes sooooo longggg!!!

...Update is coming soon because the result is still unrealiable, simple, and lacking of refinements
