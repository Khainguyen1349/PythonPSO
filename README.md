# PythonPSO
My first try on an serious Python project, and it's about PSO Algorithm integrated for Matching Network

To understand the work, I suggest you read either *MN_handle.ipynp* or *PSOsinc.ipynp* first:

- *MN_handle.ipynp* is about general input/output Matching Network calculation

- *PSOsinc.ipynp* is to go through every step of Particle Swam Optimization. This step is important for later development, it simplifies a lot is you want later use PSO for other calculation

Finally, I can jump into *PSOMatchingNetwork.ipynp* file to see how I merged these file above.

...Update is coming soon because the result is still unralizable anf the algorithm is simple, lacking of refinements
